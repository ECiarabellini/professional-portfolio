# professional-portfolio


## Description

This is a portfolio of work to showcase projects that I have completed during my journey to becoming a software engineer. The motivation behind this is to practice and showcase the skills that I learned during The Odin Project coursework as well as the Michigan State Univeristy Coding Bootcamp.

In building this webpage, I learned about designing with a mobile-first methodology. I have two formats: one for screen sizes with a width of 992px or smaller (mobile devices) and another for screens larger than 992px.
